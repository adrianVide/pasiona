# Pasiona test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## On first run

It is needed to install it globally.

### `npm install -g json-server`

## On any run

In the project directory, run:

### `json-server db.json`

After that, on another terminal instance but still same directory:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

The WebApp will be running on localhost:3001

## To run the test suite

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install --only=dev`
### `npm test`

That's pretty much it, enjoy.
